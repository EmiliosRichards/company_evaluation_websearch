> You are building a new project using the handover_bundle/ folder as a template framework.
> First read handover_bundle/START_HERE.md (or project_build_plan.md if START_HERE is not present), then implement the new system described in handover_bundle/project_build_plan.md: detect which ecommerce platform a shop uses (Magento/Shopware/WooCommerce/Shopify/Other/Unknown) using OpenAI Responses API with Web Search enabled, Flex processing, prompt caching when possible, strict JSON Schema outputs, and incremental CSV+JSONL writing with cost/tool-call metadata.
> Treat the code in handover_bundle/manuav_eval and handover_bundle/scripts as the baseline framework to refactor: rename prefixes (e.g. MANUAV_ → SHOPTECH_), replace the rubric + schema, rewrite the evaluator prompt for platform detection, update list-runner CSV columns, and update tests accordingly. Keep the existing “soft second query” toggle and the gated low-confidence retry toggle (optional, off by default) and ensure costs/tool usage are aggregated correctly when retry triggers.
> Do not remove observability: keep tracing and analysis scripts. Ensure pytest passes.
